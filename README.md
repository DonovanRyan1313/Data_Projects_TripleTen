# Data_Projects_TripleTen
Here are the projects I've completed through the TripleTen Course
| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Advanced Spreadsheets Project: Analysis of vacation rental markets in Manhattan | Tasked by a consulting company for a client interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. The role in the project was to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights. Successfully explored and filtered the data, identified which type of properties should be targeted, calculated occupancy, and estimated revenue for an investment property. |
| 2 | “Zuber” Project - Data Collection & Storage | My task was to find patterns in the available datasets. The goal was to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Working with a database I analyzed data from competitors and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. Performed exploratory data analysis, determined if and how the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays compared to other days of the week and other weather conditions. |
| 3 | E-Commerce Project: Business Analytics | Prepared analysis for an e-commerce company raw transaction logs to help the executive team understand how well the website is converting product page views into purchases. Created a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website, built acquisition cohorts based on the month of a user’s first purchase, and tracked cohort metrics month by month. Main analysis consisted of filtering purchases, calculating first purchase dates, setting up monthly data to build and track cohorts, aggregation of the purchase data into cohorts and then calculation of retention rates for each cohort month by month. Finally grouped data into cohorts, calculated overall retention rates, and organized and documented the spreadsheet. |
| 4 | Superstore Project - Data Visualization with Tableau | Identified the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore, the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers, identified which product subcategories the store should focus on and which they should stop selling. Identified the 3 best combinations of states and months of the year to advertise in. Created a visualization of the average profit for each month of the year for those 3 states and argued how much they should be willing to pay in advertising for those states in those months. Identified which products have the highest return rate and which customers have the highest return rate and created a visual to showcase them. |
| 5 | Tableau Project: Storytelling with Data | In this project we prepared an analysis for the CEO of a Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. Successfully built a dashboard for monitoring returns, presented my analysis and dashboard. |
| 6 | Power BI Project - Shopify Reviews | Tasked to review the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform, using data scraped from publicly available Shopify websites. Figured out what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app. Produced a visualization using DAX formulas in a Power BI report for each target area including app landscape, reviews, and app reviews. |
| 7 | Final Project - Zomato Restaurant Analysis (Tableau)  | Tasked to test multiple datasets to analyze the business performance of restaurants and customers registered in the service. Key goal was to find out what restaurants are popular, what restaurants generate the highest revenue and why. Utilized a variety of different visualizations including scatterplots, bar charts, tree maps, and stacked bar charts to justify my data. |
